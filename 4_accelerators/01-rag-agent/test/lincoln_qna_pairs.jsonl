{"Question": "What was the largest game that Abraham Lincoln ever shot, and did this event spark a passion for hunting in him?", "Answer": "When the smoke had cleared away, it was observed that one of the turkeys lay dead on the field. This is said to have been the largest game on which Lincoln ever pulled a trigger, his brilliant success in this instance having no power to excite in him the passion for hunting."}  
{"Question": "How did Lincoln respond when advised to turn out Mr. Chase from his Cabinet during the Presidential nomination?", "Answer": "Being in Washington for a time, I had a conversation with Mr. Lincoln about Mr. Chase's candidacy, and I advised Mr. Lincoln to turn him out.

{"Question": "What humorous event occurred when Abraham Lincoln and a Judge agreed to trade horses without seeing them first?", "Answer": "At the hour appointed the Judge came up, leading the sorriest looking specimen of a horse ever seen in those parts. In a few minutes Mr. Lincoln was seen approaching with a wooden saw-horse upon his shoulders. Great were the shouts and the laughter of the crowd, and both were greatly increased when Mr. Lincoln, on surveying the Judge's animal, set down his saw-horse, and exclaimed: 'Well, Judge, this is the first time I ever got the worst of it in a horse trade.'"}  
{"Question": "What was Abraham Lincoln's response to the suggestion of entirely reconstructing his Cabinet, as described in the story of Joe Wilson and his 'spotted animals'?", "Answer": "'Gentlemen, when I was a young man I used to know very well one Joe Wilson, who built himself a log-cabin not far from where I lived. Joe was very fond of eggs and chickens, and he took a good deal of pains in fitting up a poultry shed. Having at length got together a choice lot of young fowls—of which he was very proud—he began to be much annoyed by the depredations of those little black and white spotted animals, which it is not necessary to name. One night Joe was awakened by an unusual cackling and fluttering among his chickens. Getting up, he crept out to see what was going on. It was a moonlight night, and he soon caught sight of half a dozen of the little pests, which, with their dam, were running in and out of the shadow of the shed. Very wrathy, Joe put a double charge into his old musket, and thought he would 'clean' out the whole tribe at one shot. Somehow he only killed one, and the balance scampered off across the field. In telling the story, Joe would always pause here, and hold his nose. 'Why didn't you follow them up, and kill the rest?' inquired the neighbors. 'Blast it,' said Joe, 'why, it was eleven weeks before I got over killin' one. If you want any more skirmishing in that line you can just do it yourselves!'"}  
{"Question": "Did Abraham Lincoln and his law partner, W. H. Herndon look alike?", "Answer": "Yes, based on the picture on page 103 of the pdf (page 102 as shown on the original books page numbers) he had a very similar beard and hairstyle to how Abraham Lincoln was depicted. However, he lacks a pipe and straw hat compared to the iconic Lincoln imagery."}  
{"Question": "How did F. B. Carpenter describe his first meeting with President Lincoln and Lincoln's reaction to his profession?", "Answer": "'Two o'clock found me one of the throng pressing toward the center of attraction, the 'blue' room. From the threshold of the 'crimson' parlor as I passed, I had a glimpse of the gaunt figure of Mr. Lincoln in the distance, haggard-looking, dressed in black, relieved only by the prescribed white gloves; standing, it seemed to me, solitary and alone, though surrounded by the crowd, bending low now and then in the process of hand-shaking, and responding half abstractedly to the well-meant greetings of the miscellaneous assemblage. Never shall I forget the electric thrill which went through my whole being at this instant. I seemed to see lines radiating from every part of the globe, converging to a focus where that plain, awkward-looking man stood, and to hear in spirit a million prayers, 'as the sound of many waters,' ascending in his behalf. Mingled with supplication I could discern a clear symphony of triumph and blessing, swelled with an ever-increasing volume. It was the voice of those who had been bondmen and bondwomen, and the grand diapason swept up from the coming ages. It was soon my privilege in the regular succession, to take that honored hand. Accompanying the act, my name and profession were announced to him in a low tone by one of the assistant secretaries, who stood by his side. Retaining my hand, he looked at me inquiringly for an instant, and said, 'Oh, yes; I know; this is the painter.' Then straightening himself to his full height, with a twinkle of the eye, he added, playfully, 'Do you think, Mr. C, that you could make a handsome picture of me?' emphasizing strongly the last word. Somewhat confused at this point-blank shot, uttered in a voice so loud as to attract the attention of those in immediate proximity, I made a random reply, and took the occasion to ask if I could see him in his study at the close of the reception. To this he replied in the peculiar vernacular of the West, 'I reckon,' resuming meanwhile the mechanical and traditional exercise of the hand which no President has ever yet been able to avoid, and which, severe as is the ordeal, is likely to attach to the position so long as the Republic endures."}  
{"Question": "How many people are depicted in the image of Lincoln's Family at home in the White House?", "Answer": "In the image on page 147 of the pdf, page 146 of the original book, there are 5 people including President Lincoln, there are two children and two other adults, one a man and one a woman."}  
{"Question": "What did President Lincoln do on his visit to the hospitals at City Point, and how did he demonstrate his physical strength?", "Answer": "'On the Monday before the assassination, when the President was on his way from Richmond, he stopped at City Point. Calling upon the head surgeon at that place, Mr. Lincoln told him that he wished to visit all the hospitals under his charge and shake hands with every soldier. The surgeon asked if he knew what he was undertaking, there being five or six thousand soldiers at that place, and it would be quite a tax upon his strength to visit all the wards and shake hands with every soldier. Mr. Lincoln answered with a smile: 'He guessed he was equal to the task; at any rate he would try, and go as far as he could; he should never, probably, see the boys again, and he wanted them to know that he appreciated what they had done for their country.' Finding it useless to try to dissuade him, the surgeon began his rounds with the President, who walked from bed to bed, extending his hand to all, saying a few words of sympathy to some, making kind inquiries of others, and welcomed by all with the heartiest cordiality. As they passed along they came to a ward in which lay a rebel who had been wounded and was a prisoner. As the tall figure of the kindly visitor appeared in sight, he was recognized by the rebel soldier, who, raising himself on his elbow in bed, watched Mr. Lincoln as he approached and extending his hand exclaimed, while tears ran down his cheeks: 'Mr. Lincoln, I have long wanted to see you, to ask your forgiveness for ever raising my hand against the old flag.' Mr. Lincoln was moved to tears. He heartily shook the hand of the repentant rebel and assured him of his good will, and with a few words of kind advice passed on. After some hours the tour of the various hospitals was made, and Mr. Lincoln returned with the surgeon to his office. They had scarcely entered, however, when a messenger came saying that one ward had been omitted, and 'the boys' wanted to see the President. The surgeon, who was thoroughly tired, and knew Mr. Lincoln must be, tried to dissuade him from going; but the good man said he must go back; he would knowingly omit no one, 'the boys' would be so disappointed. So he went with the messenger, accompanied by the surgeon, and shook hands with the gratified soldiers, and then returned again to the office. The surgeon expressed the fear that the President's arm would be lamed with so much hand-shaking, saying it certainly must ache. Mr. Lincoln smiled, and saying something about his 'strong muscles,' stepped out at the open door, took up a very large, heavy axe which lay there by a log of wood, and chopped vigorously for a few moments, sending the chips flying in all directions; and then, pausing, he extended his right arm to its full length, holding the axe out horizontally, without its even quivering as he held it. Strong men who looked on—men accustomed to manual labor—could not hold the same axe in that position for a moment. Returning to the office he took a glass of lemonade, for he would take no stronger beverage; and while he was within the chips he had chopped were gathered up and safely cared for by a hospital steward because they were 'the chips that Father Abraham chopped.'"}  
{"Question": "What unusual event did Abraham Lincoln host at the Presidential residence, and what were some of the notable occurrences during this event?", "Answer": "'It is stated on the authority of the Boston Evening Gazette, that Abraham Lincoln once gave a spiritual soiree at the Presidential residence to test the wonderful alleged supernatural powers of one Mr. Charles E: Shockle. The party consisted of the President, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Wells, Mr. Stanton and two other gentlemen. For some half-hour the demonstrations were of a physical character—tables were moved, and a picture of Henry Clay, which hangs on the wall, was swayed more than a foot, and two candelabra, presented by the Dey of Algiers to President Adams, was twice raised nearly to the ceiling. At length loud rappings were heard directly beneath the President's feet, and Mr. Shockle stated that an Indian desired to communicate. 'I shall be happy to hear what his Indian majesty has to say,' replied the President, 'for I have very recently received a deputation of our red brethren, and it was the only delegation, black, white or blue, which did not volunteer some advice about the conduct of the war.' The medium then called for a pencil and paper, which were laid upon the table, and afterwards covered with a handkerchief. Presently knocks were heard and the paper was uncovered. To the surprise of all present, it read as follows: 'Haste makes waste, but delays cause vexations. Give vitality by energy. Use every means to subdue. Proclamations are useless. Make a bold front and fight the enemy; leave traitors at home to the care of loyal men. Less note of preparation, less parade and policy talk, and more action.—Henry Knox.' 'That is not Indian talk, Mr. Shockle,' said the President. 'Who is Henry Knox?' The medium, speaking in a strange voice, replied, 'The first Secretary of War.' 'Oh, yes; General Knox,' said the President. 'Stanton, that message is for you; it is from your predecessor. I should like to ask General Knox to tell us when this rebellion will be put down.' The answer was oracularly indefinite. The spirit said that Napoleon thought one thing, Lafayette another, and that Franklin differed from both. 'Ah,' exclaimed the President, 'opinions differ among the saints as well as among the sinners. Their talk is very much like the talk of my cabinet. I wish the spirits would tell us how to catch the Alabama?' The lights almost instantaneously became so dim that it was impossible to distinguish the features of any one in the room, and on the large mirror over the mantlepiece, there appeared a sea-view, the Alabama, with all steam up, flying from the pursuit of another large steamer. Two merchantmen in the distance were seen partially destroyed by fire. The picture changed, and the Alabama was seen at anchor under the shadow of an English fort, from which an English flag was flying. The Alabama was floating idly, not a soul on board, and no signs of life visible about her. The picture vanished, and, in letters of purple, appeared: 'The American people demand this of the English aristocracy.' 'So England is to seize the Alabama, finally?' said the President. 'It may be possible, but Mr. Wells, do not let one gunboat or one monitor less be constructed.' 'Well, Mr. Shockle,' continued he, 'I have seen strange things, and heard rather odd remarks, but nothing that convinces me, except the pictures, that there is anything very heavenly about all this. I should like, if possible, to hear what Judge Douglas says about this war.' After an interval of about three minutes, Mr. Shockle rose quickly from his chair and stood behind it. Resting his left hand on the back, his right into his bosom, he spoke in a voice such as no one could mistake who had ever heard Mr. Douglas. He urged the President to throw aside all advisers who hesitated about the policy to be pursued, and said that if victory were followed up by energetic action, all would be well. 'I believe that,' said the President, 'whether it comes from spirit or human. It needs not a ghost from 'the bourne from which no traveler returns' to tell that.'"}
