It processes all inputs and outputs through the same neural network, offering fast response times and improved performance in non-English languages, vision, and audio understanding compared to previous models [source](gpt-4o-system-card.pdf).\n\nGPT-o1 improved upon GPT-4o by enhancing reasoning capabilities through chain-of-thought processes. This allows for better adherence to safety policies, improved handling of jailbreaks, and more robust performance across various benchmarks, including coding and math [source](o1_system_card.pdf)."

This involves a combination of a CLIP image encoder and a small auxiliary model to predict safety scores. Data cleaning and manual verification were used to enhance accuracy (Source: DALL_E_3_System_Card-compressed.pdf).\n\n2. **Classifier Guidance**: An algorithm nudges the diffusion model away from generating unsolicited racy content by resubmitting prompts with a special flag when racy content is detected (Source: DALL_E_3_System_Card-compressed.pdf).\n\n3. **Bias and Representation**: Efforts were made to portray diverse groups and mitigate biases. The system uses prompt transformations to ensure diverse and accurate representations in image generation (Source: DALL_E_3_System_Card-compressed.pdf).\n\n4. **Public Figures Image Generation**: Mitigations include refusals, blocklists, and prompt transformations to prevent generating images of public figures, reducing risks of misinformation and ethical concerns (Source: DALL_E_3_System_Card-compressed.pdf).\n\n5. **CBRN and Scientific Knowledge**: The model was tested for generating content related to chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear risks, with findings showing minimal risk due to inaccuracies and refusals (Source: DALL_E_3_System_Card-compressed.pdf).\n\nThese layers aim to enhance the safety and reliability of DALL-E 3 in generating appropriate and diverse content."

It performs better on unambiguous questions, selecting the correct answer 94% of the time compared to GPT-4o's 72% (source: [o1_system_card.pdf](o1_system_card.pdf)).\n\n2. **Jailbreak Resistance**: The o1 models demonstrate improved robustness against jailbreaks, which are adversarial prompts designed to bypass content restrictions. They perform better on challenging evaluations like StrongReject (source: [o1_system_card.pdf](o1_system_card.pdf)).\n\n3. **Disallowed Content**: The o1 models either match or outperform GPT-4o in refusing to generate harmful content and in not over-refusing benign requests. They show significant improvement in challenging refusal evaluations (source: [o1_system_card.pdf](o1_system_card.pdf)).\n\n4. **Hallucination**: The o1-preview model hallucinates less frequently than GPT-4o, meaning it provides more accurate responses to fact-seeking questions (source: [o1_system_card.pdf](o1_system_card.pdf)).\n\n5. **Persuasiveness**: In persuasion evaluations, o1-preview (post-mitigation) is found to be marginally more persuasive than GPT-4o, suggesting improved rhetorical capabilities (source: [o1_system_card.pdf](o1_system_card.pdf)).\n\nOverall, the o1 models show advancements in safety, accuracy, and persuasive communication, making them a more robust option compared to GPT-4o."
